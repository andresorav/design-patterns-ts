# OOP Design Patterns implemented in TypeScript

## Creational Patterns

### Abstract Factory Pattern
Offers the interface (abstract factory) for creating a families of related objects (factories), without explicitly specifying their classes.

Useful for creating another abstraction around Factory method pattern.

## Structural Patterns

### Adapter Pattern
Converts the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.

Useful when combining the capability of two independent interfaces.

### Bridge Pattern
Helps to decouple implementation class and abstract class by providing a bridge structure between them.

Useful when you have an abstraction that has different implementations. It allows the abstraction and the implementation to vary independently of each other.
